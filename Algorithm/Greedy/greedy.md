# Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm solves problem by repeatedly making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope that these local solutions will lead to a globally optimal solution. The key idea is to make decisions that seem the best at the moment and move forward without revisiting previous decisions.

## Characteristics

1. Local Optimal Choice: At every step, the algorithm makes the best possible decision based on the current situation.
2. Irreversibility: Once a choice is made, it cannot be undone or modified.
3. Efficiency: usually fast, but they do not always guarantee an optimal solution for every problem

### Steps

1. Selection of the Optimal Solution: it selects the most optimal solution at the current step.
2. Validation: it checks whether the chosen solution is valid for the overall problem.
3. Check Termination: it verifies if the problem is fully solved and terminates when no more choices are available.
